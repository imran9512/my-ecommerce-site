    intro: "<h1 class=\"mb-4 text-center text-3xl font-bold\">Attentra & Strattera in Pakistan</h1>",
    outro: [
      "<h2 class=\"text-1xl mt-4 font-bold\">What is atomoxetine & why it matters</h2><p class=\"ml-4\">Atomoxetine is the only non-stimulant medicine approved for long-term ADHD treatment in children, adolescents, and adults. Unlike methylphenidate, it does not increase dopamine in the reward pathway, so there is no \"high,\" no crash, and no sleep-onset insomnia. Doctors in Lahore, Karachi, and Islamabad now prescribe atomoxetine when stimulants fail, when anxiety co-exists, or when parents prefer a once-daily capsule that lasts 24 hours. The molecule was originally developed by Eli Lilly and is sold worldwide under the brand name Strattera; in Pakistan, the same molecule is marketed as Attentra by Barrett Hodgson and as Strattera by Hilton Pharma, both in 40 mg and 60 mg hard-gel capsules.</p><br>",
      "<h2 class=\"text-1xl font-bold\">Attentra vs Strattera in Pakistan – same molecule, different price</h2><p class=\"ml-4\">Because Attentra is locally repacked, its blister carries a green Urdu strip and costs ess than the imported Strattera price. The price of a 40 mg Attentra tablet in Pakistan is given under the product\’s card for a 28-capsule pack, while the same strength of Strattera blister is priced high. Both are temperature-sensitive (store below 25 °C) and carry the same EU batch number printed on foil – so efficacy is identical. Patients who search \"Strattera price in Pakistan\" usually find the Attentra option cheaper; pharmacists confirm the switch is seamless if the milligram strength matches.</p><br>",
      "<h2 class=\"text-1xl font-bold\">Atomoxetine uses, dosage & first-month experience.</h2><p class=\"ml-4\">Atomoxetine uses include classic ADHD symptoms: inattention, hyperactivity, impulsivity, emotional lability, and executive-function deficits. The starting dose is 0.5 mg/kg daily for seven days, followed by 1.2 mg/kg (maximum 100 mg) thereafter. Most adults begin with 40 mg; if their weight is < 70 kg, they stay on 40 mg, if > 70 kg, they jump to 80 mg after week 1. The capsule could be opened and sprinkled on yoghurt for children who cannot swallow. First benefits appear at day 4 (better sitting tolerance), with the peak effect by week 4 (improved reading speed and fewer interruptions). Common atomoxetine side effects include appetite suppression, mild nausea, and afternoon sleepiness – all of which are transient and dose-related.</p><br>",
      "<h2 class=\"text-1xl font-bold\">Why buy atomoxetine online in Pakistan from us?</h2><p class=\"ml-4\">We are the only verified e-pharmacy that imports both Attentra and Strattera directly from BHR Pharma and Eli Lilly, stores them at 18°C, and ships them in insulated boxes during the summer. Every blister carries a QR code that verifies authenticity on the manufacturer\’s site. Online transfer / Cash on delivery is accepted, and the price you see at checkout is locked – no hidden courier surcharges. Bulk buyers (purchasing three blisters or more) receive an additional discount.</p><br>",
      "<h2 class=\"text-1xl font-bold\">Real patient stories & long-term benefits</h2><p class=\"ml-4\">A 28-year-old software engineer from Islamabad reported finishing tasks 40 % faster after four weeks on 40 mg Attentra; his GitHub commit graph doubled. A mother from Peshawar says her 9-year-old son now completes classwork without reminders and sleeps through the night. Because atomoxetine is not a controlled stimulant, you can legally carry it while travelling and even split the capsule to titrate the dose. Long-term studies show sustained height, weight, and blood-pressure profiles – making it the safest choice for growing children and professionals who need 12-hour focus without rebound.</p><br>",
      "<h2 class=\"text-1xl font-bold\">How to order & what to expect next</h2><p class=\"ml-4\">Click \“Add to Cart\”, select the desired strength (Attentra or Strattera), pay with cash on delivery, and start taking the capsule tomorrow morning. You will receive a bilingual patient leaflet, a dosage diary, and a WhatsApp follow-up reminder on days 7 and 28. If you experience nausea, take the capsule after breakfast. If afternoon fatigue persists, consider adjusting the dose to be taken at bedtime. Order today and turn scattered thoughts into laser-sharp focus – the Pakistani workplace is competitive, but atomoxetine gives you the calm edge you deserve.</p>",
